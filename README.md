# Foundational-Coursework-Projects

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my technical projects and assignments from the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of California, Davis.

The projects are organized into folders corresponding to each specific course. This collection demonstrates my hands-on application of core concepts in programming, algorithms, computer architecture, and systems-level engineering.

## Key Highlights

This section features the most significant and impactful projects from the collection that best represent my core skills in systems and low-level programming.

*   **ConnectN Game (from ECS 036A - C Programming):** Architected and implemented a fully functional, command-line N-in-a-row game, demonstrating a strong command of pointers, dynamic memory management, and algorithmic logic in C.
*   **Low-Level Programming in RISC-V (from EEC 170 - Computer Architecture):** Developed a series of programs directly in RISC-V assembly, manipulating memory and implementing complex control flow to gain a fundamental understanding of how software interacts with processor hardware.
*   **Advanced Data Structures (from ECS 036C - C++):** Engineered robust, from-scratch implementations of complex data structures, including Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, and a Red-Black Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree, applying object-oriented principles in C++.
